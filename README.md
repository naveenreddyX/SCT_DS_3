Decision Tree Classifier - Bank Marketing Dataset

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

We use the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

ðŸš€ Steps in the Project
	1.	Load Dataset â€“ Import the CSV file.
	2.	Data Preprocessing â€“ Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualize feature distributions and target class imbalance.
	4.	Model Building â€“ Train a Decision Tree Classifier on training data.
	5.	Model Evaluation â€“ Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
	6.	Visualization â€“ Plot the decision tree to understand the decision-making process.
